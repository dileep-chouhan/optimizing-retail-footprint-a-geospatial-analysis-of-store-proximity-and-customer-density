# Optimizing Retail Footprint: A Geospatial Analysis of Store Proximity and Customer Density

**Overview:**

This project performs a geospatial analysis to optimize a retail company's footprint.  The analysis identifies optimal locations for new stores and suggests adjustments to existing store locations by considering proximity to high-density customer areas and minimizing competition from existing stores.  The project leverages geospatial data and statistical analysis to provide data-driven recommendations for strategic retail expansion and optimization.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas (likely -  mention if used)
* [Add other libraries as needed]


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You may need to adjust file paths within `main.py` to point to your own data files.  The project assumes data is in a specific format (which should be documented within the code or in a separate data description file).


**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings and analysis results to the console, including metrics such as average customer density near existing and potential new store locations, competitive analysis, and suggested adjustments to the store footprint.  Additionally, the analysis generates several visualization files (e.g., maps showing customer density, store locations, and potential new store sites) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations will include:

* Maps showing the spatial distribution of customer density and existing stores.
* Maps suggesting optimal locations for new stores.
* Charts illustrating key metrics (e.g., average distance to customers).

The specific output files and their formats will depend on the data and analysis performed.  Refer to the code comments for details.
